# ClaudeController TODO Implementation Loop

## Overview
This document tracks the systematic implementation of all outstanding TODO items in the ClaudeController project. The goal is to complete every feature request, improvement, and bug fix in a methodical, test-driven approach.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Token Analysis Features
1. **tokens --tasks flag** - Task-based tracking using `isSidechain` property
2. **tokens --all flag** - Unified task/todo view
3. **tokens --brief flag** - Concise output format
4. **Unique todo/task IDs** - Hash-based unique identifiers

### Phase 2: Code Quality & Bug Fixes  
5. **Type hinting** - Add type annotations across all Python scripts
6. **Fix unknown todos** - Debug lifecycle tracking issues

### Testing Approach
For each implementation:
- Write tests first where applicable
- Test all existing functionality remains intact
- Test new features thoroughly with various inputs
- Verify integration with existing token analysis system

### Commit Strategy
- One feature per commit with descriptive messages
- Test thoroughly before each commit
- Push after each successful implementation
- Update TODO.md to move completed items to "Completed" section

## Progress Tracking

### Token Estimation Accuracy Target
- Aim for estimates within 50% of actual token usage
- Document significant variances for future reference
- Update CLAUDE.md guidelines based on learnings

### Success Criteria
- All TODO items moved to "Completed" section
- All tests passing
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Code properly typed and documented
- Clean git history with descriptive commits

## Notes
- Using systematic approach per CLAUDE.md guidelines
- Following existing code patterns and conventions
- Leveraging plugin architecture for token command extensions
- Maintaining backward compatibility throughout

## Current Status
**Started:** {timestamp}
**Estimated Total:** ~97k tokens across all items
**Critical Path:** tokens features → bug fixes → code quality

**Do not stop until all TODO items are completed.**
